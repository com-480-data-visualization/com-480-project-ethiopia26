# Torchlurk

CNNs do a great job at recognizing images (so far). Troubles arrive when it comes to talk about interprability of the network: although one coded the network in question, and one knows all the tips and tricks necessary to train it efficiently, one does not necessarily know **how** it generates the output from a given image.

Torchlurk aims at allowing any user to visualize his/her Pytorch network in an efficient yet simple manner, providing a similar interface as [Microscope](https://microscope.openai.com/models/alexnet/conv5_1_0) tailored for a specific CNN network. All you need is the trained pytorch network and its training set. That's it.
